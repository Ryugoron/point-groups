===== Installation =====

The point-groups Project is only supported for *nix platforms.

To install point-groups you have to first read the "Setup" section.
Normally you only need to do the steps in the section "setup" once, it may
be necessary to do it again, due to changes.

===== Setup =====

We are using maven (http://maven.apache.org/) as dependency resolver.
Unfortunatly, we have some dependencies that are not in any official maven
repositories and because it is mainly third-party software with different
licenses, we can't host a maven repository for the missing dependencies.

But we want to use maven as depedency resolver to make sure that everything is
available at compile time.

So we wrote an ant script that will setup a local maven repository with all the
needed jar files. This files will be downloaded from the respective places.

To setup the project simply run

> ant setup

Please check, whether you are compiling to the respective licenses of the
third-party libraries.

===== Compile the project =====

To compile the project simply run

> mvn package

===== Further requirements =====

=== polymake (required) ===

Our project makes use of polymake (http://polymake.org), which will be called at
runtime.

If you don't have polymake, you can download it from the website and compile it.

*OR* you can use the following ant script to do the job

> ant compile-polymake

Note: Our project was mainly tested against polymake version 2.12-rc3, so it is
prefered to use this version.

=== OpenGL (optional, but recommended) ===
